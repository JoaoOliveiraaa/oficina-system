-- Disable email confirmation requirement
-- This allows users to sign up and login immediately without email verification
-- Note: This should be configured in Supabase Dashboard under Authentication > Providers > Email
-- Set "Confirm email" to disabled

-- This script is just a reminder that you need to:
-- 1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
-- 2. Navigate to Authentication > Providers
-- 3. Click on Email provider
-- 4. Disable "Confirm email" option
-- 5. Save changes

-- Alternatively, you can disable it via SQL by updating auth.config
-- But it's recommended to do it through the dashboard for better control
